## About the Demo Application

This project uses the **"Online Boutique"** demo application developed by Google. This is a mock application that simulates an online shop, comprised of 11 microservices. While the implementation of each service is simplified compared to realistic applications, it effectively illustrates the structure and operation of a reasonably complex cloud-native application.

The demo application is available from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). The main documentation can be found in the top-level README file and in the docs folder.

> **Note:** This demo application used to be named "Hipster Shop". Some documents and code/configuration files may still reference this name.
